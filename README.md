### Key Concepts
- 2 main types
- Supervised learning (predict some output valuable that is associated with each input item). _Learning to predict target values from labelled data._ If the outout is a category with a finite and defined number of possibilities, then this is a classification task, and the function we train is a classifier. If the output variable is a number (e.g. amount of time in seconds, building energy usage), then this is a regression task, and we train a regression function.
- We typically denote a table of data items using X, with one data item per row. Target value (label) is
